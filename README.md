### Takeaways

This project was the first in a series of challenges I'm undertaking to improve my front-end and overall web development skills. In this project, I built a very simple recipe web page to get accustomed to building a web page based on a mockup, and general web development workflow.

For this project, I used the most basic HTML and CSS so I could get feedback on the fundamental aspects of my HTML/CSS structuring. As I complete more projects, I hope to learn more modern technologies/frameworks one-by-one.

Most of the difficulty in this project was in minor changes to the spacing of elements to get them to better align with the mockup design. In particular, getting the spacing of the unordered/ordered lists to work properly. I'm still not confident that I completed this in an idiomatic way, may try to look at the source for websites with similar list structuring.
